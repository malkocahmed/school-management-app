This project included developing front-end for web pages using HTML5 and CSS3, also as back-end using
JavaScript and Node.js. Back-end development also included developing database using sequelize, MySQL and
phpMyAdmin. Project was divided in four separate tasks. While working on this project, among other things, I
became very familiar with asynchronous functions, AJAX, jQuery, HTTP protocol.
